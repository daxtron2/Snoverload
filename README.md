Snoverload is an infinite runner game with a twist. You control a snowball, endlessly tumbling down an infinite mountain. Collect snowballs off the ground to gain in size. If you get too big though, you'll break apart! Hit objects in your path to reduce your size, but don't let yourself get too small either or you'll disintegrate! You can collect powerups to help you reach the highest score! When your run is over, don't fret! All of the snowballs you've collected can be used to buy upgrades and skins for your snowball and the environment around you.
